## Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl

I was most impressed by the scope of analysis presented in this article. The ability to conduct a global analysis of street networks over the past 40 years speaks to the analytical power of big data sources. The different methods of presenting vast amounts of complex data in maps, charts, and tables necessitates a discerning researcher to determine the visualization method for both analysis and communication. I found most interesting the discussion about regional differences that might explain variations in the data, such as China's superblocks or Denmark's pedestrian paths. While this paper is a highly technical analysis, the social, policy, and political aspects are closedly intertwined with the discussion. In particular, I disliked the framing of "low-income" and "high-income" countries, as per the World Banks's definition, as well as the casual mentions of Spanish colonial grids in Latin America. The griddedness of the colonial streets as contrasted with the sprawl of informal settlements implies a preference for the colonial legacy, and does not take into account the socioeconomic conditions resulting in informal settlements on urban peripheries. How can this data be used within a critical cartography framework? How can data analysts bring historical and political power dynamics into highly-technical discussions? 

Questions:
* Can you further explain the process used to create the street-network timeseries? I'd like to hear more about using satellite imagery to create historical spatial data.
* How big was this dataset? Did you use supercomputers to run this analysis? 
* How did you determine the best way to present the data? 
* What other analysis do you see possible with these data sources?
* In addition to the necessary technical analysis, what other theoretical backgrounds undergird your work, particularly in choosing to define countries as "low-income" vs. "high-income" and speculating on policy remedies for the future?
