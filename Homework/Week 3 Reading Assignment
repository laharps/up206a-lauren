# Off the Grid... and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design
Jeff Boeing (2020)

<p> This article is a fascinating example of urban data spatial analysis and the possibilities of data visualization. I had actually seen Figure 3, which shows urban street network orientation, on several urbanist social media sites. It was fascinating to read more about the data analysis that went into those figures. I was impressed that most of the data that went into this analysis was open source data -- it took a creative data analyst to see the potential for combining those data sources in a new way to contribute to the literature on urban form. </p>

<p> The concept of grid planning has its roots in colonialism -- from the grids of Roman colonies to settler colonial towns in the American Midwest. The article argues that grid is an effective method of city planning because it supports walkability and car independence. In recent years, the suburban development has favored looping dead-end streets that heavily incentize car ownership. Personally, I wonder how far the city grid can be taken as a matter of urban form. My favorite cities are those with a medieval urban center with twisting narrow streets that were never made for cars and planned at the human scale. Some of the cities I disklike most, such as Salt Lake City (as quoted in the epigraph) or Austin, have massive gridded canyons, completely out of scale with the experience of an urban pedestrian. </p>
